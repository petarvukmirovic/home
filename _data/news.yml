            <a href="https://www.tptp.org/CASC/J10/"> CASC</a> automatic
            theorem prover competition, <a

            Zipperposition 2</a> won the first place in THF (higher-order
            theorem) division. I was the lead developer of Zipperposition in the
            last two years, and prepared Zipperposition 2 CASC submission, but
            Zipperposition owes it performance to outstanding work of many other
            people. Some of those include: <a
            href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~abp290/">Alexander Bentkamp</a> who is
            the main author of <a href="#publications"> superposition with lambdas</a> calculus; <a
            href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/automation-of-logic/people/sophie-tourret/">
            Sophie Tourret</a> who implemented infinite stream management; Visa
            Nummelin who helped improve Boolean reasoning support; <a
            href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jbe248/">Jasmin Blanchette</a> who
            supervised work of Alexander, Visa and me; <a
            href="https://simon.cedeela.fr/">Simon Cruanes</a>  who is the
            creator of Zipperposition and who guided us through its ins and
            outs. We have also implemented <a
            href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-51074-9_16">combinator-based
            calculus by Bhayat and Reger</a>; we have further been inspired by
            many advanced ideas implemented in <a
            href="https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~cebrown/satallax/">Satallax</a>,
            and by Hilbert choice treatment of <a
            href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/lex/leo3/">Leo-III</a>. 
            Many of the advanced heuristic schemes from E have been reimplemented 
            (and lifted to higher-order logic) in Zipperposition. Many thanks
            to <a href="http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/DHBW_Stephan_Schulz/Stephan_Schulz.html">Stephan Schulz</a>.
            <br/> If
            you are interested in using Zipperposition in your own project, send
            me an <a href="mailto:p.vukmirovic@vu.nl">email</a> and I will
            gladly help you.'
