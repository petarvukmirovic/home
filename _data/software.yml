  description: 'In the last two years I have been the main developer of the
                Zipperposition theorem prover. It is a well-performing
                polymorphic higher-order theorem prover. Unlike other provers
                like E or Vampire, Zipperposition does not have an <span class="em"> auto </span>
                mode. Therefore, if you would like to use it in your projects let me know
                and I will provide you with a reasonable configuration to use in your domain.'
